Kia ora, my name is Aeron. I come from Wellington, New Zealand, and my mission is to create a life filled with creativity, connection and meaningful work that makes the world a better place. 

I have developed a myriad of skills from working across multiple industries, and currently I am taking a leap into the tech sector to see what might be possible when I bring my skillset, experience and values of being open and honest to the table.
