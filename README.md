## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Kia ora, my name is Aeron. I come from Wellington, New Zealand, and my mission is to create a life filled with creativity, connection and meaningful work that makes the world a better place. 

I have developed a myriad of skills from working across multiple industries, and currently I am taking a leap into the tech sector to see what might be possible when I bring my skillset, experience and values of being open and honest to the table. 

## Projects
### PokÃ©mon Arcade
This was my final group project for Dev Academy Aotearoa. We decided to create an online PokÃ©mon-themed single page gaming app, written using TypeScript, React, Express and PostgreSQL. Showcases Auth0 integration, state management, and external API integration. I took on the role of Agile Facilitator, running daily stand ups and delegating tasks. \ 
I grew up playing the PokÃ©mon games and was thrilled to be a part of recreating the magic. I found animating the player sprite to be particularly rewarding, and gained a lot of respect for the mechanics of the games in the process - it was more complicated than I thought! This was also great practice in collaborative coding, task delegation and gitflow. \
The project is currently on hold while the rest of the coding course is completed, however I have added comments in client/index.tsx for ways we can make it even better.
